# SEDs
		This repository contains the SEDs for Population III stars and 
	Pop III galaxies used in our paper (Mas-Ribas et al. 2016). See the 
	article for detailed descriptions of the parameters used, calculation 
	procedures and references. 

		The SEDs are computed for zero-metallicity stars (H_He only) in 
	the ZAMS phase. We use the stellar parameters from Schaerer 2002 
	(2002A&A...382...28S) and Marigo 2001 ( 2001A&A...371..152M) as 
	reported in Kub√°t 2012 (2012ApJS..203...20K). 

	Every file contains two columns:
		First column - frequency     [Hz]
									The SEDs have been computed into a common frequency 
									array of 19 000 points linearly spaced from 5e12 to 
									5e16 Hz. The values have been computed using linear 
									interpolation.
		Second column - flux         H_\nu [erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} Hz^{-1} sr^{-1}( {M_\odot}^{-1}
									for the case of galaxy SEDs)].
									Note that this is the Eddington flux, so one needs to 
									multiply by 4\pi to obtain the flux F_\nu.

## Stellar SEDs
The names of the files denote the stellar mass.

## Galaxy SEDs
The names of the files denote the parameters of the IMFs; e.g, IMF_m9M50a2 means a population with lower stellar mass
limit of 9 solar masses, upper limit 50 solar masses and Salpeter slope, -2.35. Note that the top-heavy IMF has a 
slope of "0" in linear space, not logarithmic.
