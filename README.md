# SEDs
		This repository contains the SEDs of Population III stars and 
	Pop III galaxies used in our paper. See the article for detailed 
	descriptions of the parameters used, calculation procedures and 
	references. 

		The SEDs are computed for zero-metallicity stars (H_He only) in 
	the ZAMS. We use the stellar parameters from Schaerer 2002 
	(2002A&A...382...28S) and Marigo 2001 ( 2001A&A...371..152M) as 
	reported in Kub√°t 2012 (2012ApJS..203...20K). 

	Every file contains two columns:
		First column - frequency [Hz]
									The SEDs have been rebinned into a common frequency 
									array of 19 000 points linearly spaced from 5e12 to 
									5e16 Hz. The values have been computed using linear 
									interpolation.
		Second column - flux H_\nu [erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} Hz^{-1} ( {M_\odot}^{-1}
									for the case of galaxy SEDs)]

## Stellar SEDs
The name of the files denotes the stellar mass.

## Galaxy SEDs
The name of the files are related to the parameters of the IMFs 
according to the article.
